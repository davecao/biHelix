biHelix
=======
A program implemented in Fortran 95/2003 is to find the properties of an alpha
helix of a protein.

The algorithm proposed by Sugeta et al is employed. This implementation
refers to helanal (in Fortran 77) developed by Kumar et al.
Except for the programming language, the main difference to helanal is that
Singular Value Decomposition is employed other than matrix inverse in helanal
to find the helical axis.
